1,What is the time complexity of binary search?,O(log n),C_base,gpt-4.1-mini,"The time complexity of binary search is **O(log n)**, where *n* is the number of elements in the sorted array or list being searched. This is because binary search repeatedly divides the search interval in half, reducing the problem size exponentially until the target element is found or the interval is empty.",2025-12-07T23:05:30.336171
1,What is the time complexity of binary search?,O(log n),C_uncertainty,gpt-4.1-mini,"The time complexity of binary search is **O(log n)**, where *n* is the number of elements in the sorted array or list being searched.

Explanation:
- Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
- Each comparison eliminates half of the remaining elements.
- Therefore, the number of steps needed to find the target (or determine it is not present) grows logarithmically with the size of the input.

If you have any more questions about binary search or algorithms, feel free to ask!",2025-12-07T23:05:32.320809

3,In Big-O notation,what is the time complexity of linear search?,C_base,gpt-4.1-mini,"Big-O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time or space requirements in terms of the input size. It characterizes the worst-case growth rate, helping to understand how the performance of an algorithm scales as the input size increases.

For example:
- **O(1)**: Constant time — the algorithm takes the same amount of time regardless of input size.
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time — the time grows logarithmically with input size.
- **O(n)**: Linear time — the time grows linearly with input size.
- **O(n log n)**: Linearithmic time — grows faster than linear but slower than quadratic.
- **O(n²)**: Quadratic time — time grows proportionally to the square of the input size.

5,What is the main data structure used in a stack?,Last in first out (LIFO) structure,C_uncertainty,gpt-4.1-mini,"The main data structure used in a stack is typically a **linked list** or an **array**. 

- When implemented with an **array**, the stack uses a contiguous block of memory, and a pointer (or index) keeps track of the top element.
- When implemented with a **linked list**, each element (node) points to the next, and the top of the stack is the head of the list.

Both implementations support the core stack operations: **push** (add an element), **pop** (remove the top element), and **peek** (view the top element) efficiently.

So, the stack itself is an abstract data type, and arrays or linked lists are common underlying data structures used to implement it.",2025-12-07T23:05:45.133598

- In some languages (like C or C++), the variable may contain a garbage or indeterminate value.
- In others (like Java or Python), the variable might have a default value (e.g., `null` or `None`).
- Some languages may raise an error if you try to use an uninitialized variable.
